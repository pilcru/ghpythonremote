************
Installation
************

Requires a Python 2.7 installation, not compatible with Python 3. Compatible with Mac and Windows with Rhino 7.

1. Install the software dependencies:
-------------------------------------

Before installing gh-python-remote in **Rhino 7**, you will need to install Python 2, Rhino 7, and open Grasshopper in Rhino 7 at least once.

Before installing gh-python-remote in **Rhino 6**, you will need to install Python 2, Rhino 6, and open Grasshopper in Rhino 6 at least once.

Before installing gh-python-remote in **Rhino 5**, you will need to install Python 2, Rhino 5, Grasshopper and GHPython, and drop the GHPython component on the Grasshopper canvas in Rhino 5 at least once.

Install the following:

:Python 2.7:
    gh-python-remote was developed with the `Anaconda`_ and `Miniconda`_ distributions in mind, but any Python 2.7 distribution works. If you already have Anaconda installed with Python 3, you do not need to reinstall it, you can create a virtual environment as explained below.

    *If you want to be able to name virtual environments in gh-python-remote by their conda name, select "Add conda to my PATH" when prompted during Anaconda's installation.*

    *On Mac, the python distributed with the OS is outdated and difficult to use by the end-user. It is* **highly** *recommended to use a conda- or* `brew`_ *-based Python.*
:Python `virtual environment`_ (optional):
    Isolate dependencies for each project by creating a new virtual environment. If you use Anaconda or Miniconda, creating a virtual environment is easy.

    - Open the Windows command prompt, or Mac terminal (or the Anaconda prompt if you chose not to add conda to your PATH during insallation)
    - Run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

       conda create --name rhinoremote python=2.7 numpy scipy

    This will create a new virtual environment named ``rhinoremote``, and install numpy and scipy in it.
:`Rhinoceros3D`_:
    Version 7 is supported on Windows and Mac. Version 5 and 6 on Windows should work, but are not supported.
:`Grasshopper`_:
    On Rhino 6 and 7, it is already installed. On Rhino 5, install version 0.9.0076. **Open it at least once before continuing.**
:`GH Python`_:
    On Rhino 6 and 7, it is already installed. On Rhino 5, install version 0.6.0.3. **On Rhino 5, drop it on the Grasshopper canvas at least once before continuing.**

2. Install gh-python-remote:
--------------------------------

From the Windows command prompt, or Mac terminal (or the special Anaconda, or Python prompt if pip is not in your path by default), run:

*(If you are using a virtual environment, remember to* **activate** *it first. With the conda virtual environment from above, you would need to run* ``conda activate rhinoremote`` *in the command prompt.)*

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install gh-python-remote --upgrade
   python -m ghpythonremote._configure_ironpython_installation

This will install gh-python-remote for Rhino 7, and install the gh-python-remote UserObject in all Grasshopper versions.

The ``ghpythonremote._configure_ironpython_installation`` script takes an optional location argument that can be ``5``, ``6``, ``7`` (default), or the path to a target IronPython package directory.

For example, to install for Rhino 5, replace the second command with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m ghpythonremote._configure_ironpython_installation 5

To install to another location:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m ghpythonremote._configure_ironpython_installation ^
     "%APPDATA%\McNeel\Rhinoceros\7.0\Plug-ins\^
     IronPython (814d908a-e25c-493d-97e9-ee3861957f49)\settings\lib"

Usage
*****

*All the examples files are copied to* ``%APPDATA%\Grasshopper\UserObjects\gh-python-remote\examples`` *on Windows, and* ``~/Grasshopper/UserObjects/gh-python-remote/examples`` *on Mac. You can also download them from the* `github repo`_.

From Grasshopper to Python
--------------------------

Step-by-step
^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Open the example file ``GH_python_remote.ghx`` in Grasshopper, or drop the gh-python-remote component on the canvas.
#. Use the ``location`` input to define the location of the Python interpreter you want to connect to.
#. Use the ``modules`` input to define the modules you want to access in the GHPython component.
#. Change ``run`` to ``True`` to connect.
#. In the GHPython component, the imported modules will now be available via the sticky dictionary. For example if you are trying to use Numpy:

   .. code-block:: python

      import scriptcontext
      np = scriptcontext.sticky['numpy']

Notes
^^^^^

Creating remote array-like objects from large local lists is slow. For example, ``np.array(range(10000))`` takes more than 10 seconds. To solve this, you need to first send the list to the remote interpreter, then create the array from this remote object:

.. code-block:: python

  import scriptcontext as sc
  import ghpythonremote
  np = sc.sticky['numpy']
  rpy = sc.sticky['rpy']

  r_range = ghpythonremote.deliver(rpy, range(10000))
  np.array(r_range)

Additionally, Grasshopper does not recognize remote list objects as lists. They need to be recovered to the local interpreter first:

.. code-block:: python

  import scriptcontext as sc
  import ghpythonremote
  from ghpythonlib.treehelpers import list_to_tree  # Rhino 6 only!
  np = sc.sticky['numpy']

  a = np.arange(15).reshape((3,5))
  a = ghpythonremote.obtain(a.tolist())
  a = list_to_tree(a, source=[0,0])


``ghpythonlib.treehelpers`` is Rhino 6 only, see the `treehelpers gist`_ for an equivalent implementation if you need it on Rhino 5.

Quick-ref:
^^^^^^^^^^

**\*** *marks an input that is only available by editing the gh-python-remote UserObject, or in* ``GH_python_remote.ghx``.

:Arguments:
    :\*codeÂ (string):
        Path to the ``GH_to_python.py`` code file.
    :location (string):
        Path to a python executable, or to a folder containing ``python.exe``, or the name of a conda-created virtual environment prefixed by ``conda://`` (``conda://env_name``, requires ``conda`` available in your PATH). If empty, finds python from your windows ``%PATH%``.
    :run (boolean):
        Creates the connection, and imports new modules, when turned to True. Kills the connection, and deletes the references to the imports, when turned to False.
    :modules (string list):
        List of module names to import in the remote python. They will be added to the ``scriptcontext.sticky`` dictionary, allowing them to be reused from other python components in the same Grasshopper document. Submodules (for example ``numpy.linalg``) have to be added explicitly to this list to be available later, and importing the parent package is also required even if only the submodule is used.
    :\*log_level (string from ['NOTSET', 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL']):
        Logging level to use for the local IronPython and the remote python instance.
    :\*working_dir (string):
        Working directory for the remote python instance.

:Returns:
    :out (string):
        Console output with DEBUG information.
    :linked_modules (string list):
        List of imported module names.
    :rpy (rpyc connection object):
        The object representing the remote Python interpreter.
    :import_statements (string):
        What to use in the GHPython component to actually use the imported modules.


From Python to Grasshopper
--------------------------

You can also use gh-python-remote to programmatically control a Rhinoceros instance, and connect to it via Python. Have a look at ``examples/python_to_GH.py`` for a full working example.
